# Exposure Notifications Android

This project was meant to help countries, health care workers, people, and organisations in their fight against COVID-19. Huge amounts of inspiration
has been derived from the reference design faciliated by Google Open Source: [reference app](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-android)
Currently only approved government public health authorities can access the APIs
(included in a rolled out build of `Google Play services`) to build an app for
COVID-19 response efforts.

# Getting Started

This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this code, use the
`gradlew build` command or use `Import Project` in Android Studio.

# About the project

This project was meant to help countries, health care workers, people, and organisations in their fight against COVID-19. To make this app work, you
will need your Government requesting Google permission to use the API. After the permission is obtained, use this app and gain a head start in your effort.
This project just needs minimal modifications(specification of server urls and endpoints) and it is ready for production.
